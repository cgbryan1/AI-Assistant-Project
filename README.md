## About the Computer Science Experience Labs

The Experience Labs' (XL) mission is to accelerate technical experience and build community among undergraduate CS majors at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The XL's web app, found in production at `csxl.unc.edu`, is backed by the same code found in this repository. Our team built on this existing codebase to implement an AI assistant feature.
